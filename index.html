<p>I've worked as a full stack software developer for two years and i have played with code since 14 years old.The applications that i have worked on strt's from the simplest one to business and data visualisation from desctop to mobile and web app.It was a cool experience to work in a team where the beauty of your code is vital for the process of application life.First i was sceptic and i thought that it was a waste of time to focus on the beauty of your code but than gradually i understud that it was not a big deal.To be a good developer doesnt mean just to sit there and just write some code and say if it works than its fine, it's much more.Programming is like sport if u practice it every day and do it with passion than your skills will grou really fast and more you read you will understand that the more you learn, the more you realize how little you know.
I have some months thinking to work as a freelancer but didnt found any godd opportunity
One day i heard from some friends about Toptal.com that has the best freelancers in the world, and i sayed to my self, can i bee part of it? Are my coding skills at the level to pass their tests?
Let me point out what made me to apply Toptal.

1.Top freelancers work there.
Only about 3% of applicants on Toptal get in, this mean they are realy careful of who they chose.You have to pass therir tests before you get in.For me this would be a great deal.

2.Work on what you are good for.
If you work for companys in your country there comes a point that you stuck in an application you have built there and it starts to get boring.At toptal you can have the opportunity to make a lot of different applications so you dont have to worry about monotony and not doing cool stuffs.

I have just submited an application on Toptal and i really want to be part of best freelancers.If you are a developer that is looking for a good oportunity than i recommend you to do the same.

Wish me luck :)</p>
